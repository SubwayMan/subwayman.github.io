![Arduino project](/images/cansat.jpg)

Hello! I'm Tyler, a student pursuing a Software Engineering degree at the University of Waterloo.

If you're reading this right now, you've managed to stumble upon my webpage, out of the billions and billions of web pages out there.
I think that's pretty cool. As for me, I'm just a student who happens to enjoy making things.

I build all sorts of random projects. The project in the thumbnail is a [miniature satellite](https://github.com/nuggetbucket54/CanSat).
I've also made a couple [game engines](https://github.com/SubwayMan/FLTK-Platformer), a LLM-powered IOT device that can record your shower thoughts,
and quite a few games. Here's an [underwater exploration and combat RPG](https://pixelpad.io/app/lfgzohcupbm/). You can also see a bunch of 
miscellaneous projects I've made from [this page](https://pixelpad.io/apps/?u=19216).

Despite all that, there's still lots to learn for me. I'm currently interested in creating my own C-based game engine, and I plan to try
and embed some games in this very website using [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/). I'm also looking forward to learning about FPGAs.

I'm currently studying at the University of Waterloo. For job offers/saying hi, feel free to use the links on the sidebar.
